    // "unconventional way". For instance, Netlify sets the Cache-Control
    // directives max-age=0 and must-revalidate. By default webhint would signal
    // such occurrences as errors. Since I know that the site is hosted on
    // Netlify (and hopefully I know how the Netlify CDN cache works), these
    // errors would be false positives.
