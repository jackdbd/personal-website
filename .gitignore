# I am generating nonces for my inline CSS and JS, so I can avoid 'unsafe inline'
# in the script-src and style-src directives of my Content-Security-Policy. As

# use placeholders and replace them at build time. That's why I keep a
# netlify.template.toml file and generate the netlify.toml from it.
