# giacomodebidda-content

This repository is my attempt at [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and it aims to be a permanent archive of all the content I publish to [giacomodebidda.com](https://giacomodebidda.com), and then maybe [syndicate](https://indieweb.org/syndication-models) elsewhere.

Text content is hosted here on GitHub. Media assets are hosted on object storage (Clouflare R2) to keep this git repository small. See the [media](./media/README.md) directory for more information.

The code for my website is hosted in [this other repository](https://github.com/jackdbd/personal-website) rather than this one. I use [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) for my site and am very happy with it. However, maintaining a separation between content and presentation is a good idea that will facilitate an easier migration to a different static site generator if I choose to do so in the future.
