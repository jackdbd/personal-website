title: Inspect container images with dive
---

Container images can be created using `docker build` with a `Dockerfile`, or with other tools such as [jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) or [pack](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack). Regardless of which tool was used to create the container image, you can use [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) to inspect all layers that make up the final image.

## Container image and container image layer

A **container image** is a read-only, immutable file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies, environment configuration, tools, and other files needed for an application to run. It has a human-readable name, a human-assigned tag, and can be used to create **containers**.

A **container image layer** is basically just an intermediate container image that has neither a name, nor a tag. You can think of a container image just as a diff of several container image layers.

The [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/) came up with a [specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) for a standard format for container images. This means that you can use any tool to create a container image, as long as such tool produces a container image that adheres to the OCI specification.

## Dive vs other tools

If you are just interested in knowing what's inside a **container**—which, remember, was built using a container image, i.e. the final container image layer—you can enter the container and have a look around.

For example, let's say that you want to know what's inside an Alpine Linux container.

First, you pull the container image from a container registry like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine):

```shell
docker pull alpine:latest
```

Second, you create a container and obtain a shell:

```shell
docker run --rm --interactive --tty alpine:latest
# or, for short
docker run --rm -it alpine:latest
```

Third, inside the Alpine container, you list all the files:

```shell
ls -1aR
```

But what if want to know how many layers there are, and how big they are? Well, for that there is [docker history](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/history/).

```shell
docker history alpine:latest
```

However, as far as I know, there is only one tool that allows you to inspect **each** layer that make up the final image, and that tool is [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive).

## Installation

You can obtain dive by downloading and installing the binary from [its GitHub releases](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/releases), or by pulling its container image with `docker pull wagoodman/dive:latest`.

## How to use dive? A few examples

### Example 1: Alpine Linux

If you don't have a local Alpine image, you can pull the latest one from Docker Hub with this command:

```shell
docker pull alpine:latest
```

You are now ready to inspect the container image layers with dive:

```shell
dive alpine:latest
```

You can switch panes with `Tab`, collapse/expand the file tree with the space bar, and exit the program with `Ctrl`+`c`.
You can read the [documentation](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive#keybindings) for the other keybindings.

Alpine is a Linux distro designed to be used in containers and embedded devices. Two of the main reasons of its small size (~5MB) are that Alpine packs 300+ UNIX tools in a **single binary**, thanks to [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), and [decided](https://youtu.be/Cc1rBayMnVI) to pick [musl](https://musl.libc.org/) as the implementation for the standard C library (see [here](https://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html) how musl compares with glibc).

Using dive you can see that the "binaries" in Alpine are just symlinks to the single binary `/bin/busybox`.

If you are curious you can also inspect the container image of BusyBox (or [Toybox](https://landley.net/toybox/), an alternative to BusyBox) and see how small it is. I'll leave you the commands here so you can copy and paste them.

```shell
docker pull busybox:latest
dive busybox:latest
```

```shell
docker pull tianon/toybox:latest
dive tianon/toybox:latest
```

### Example 2: JDK vs JRE in a Clojure app

If you are developing a Java/Clojure/Kotlin/Scala application (or any language which compiles to Java bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine), you need the Java Development Kit (JDK). However, once that application is compiled and packaged into an uberjar, it can be run either with the JDK or with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

There are many ways to create a container image which can run an uberjar. I like to use [pack](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack). With pack you don't need a `Dockerfile` to create a container image. You simply specify a path to your source code, a [builder](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/), and let the builder build the container image for you.

I had a Clojure application and I decided to use pack and the [Paketo Tiny Builder](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/tiny-builder) to create a container image. This is the command I used:

```shell
pack build my_clojure_app:latest \
  --path . \
  --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny
```

The generated container image is roughly 180 MB, mostly due to the layer containing the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is 148 MB.

https://res.cloudinary.com/jackdbd/image/upload/v1643979796/clojure_app_jre.png

You don't really need to know pack, builders and [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/buildpack/) to understand this example. The only thing you need to know is that a builder is itself a container image, and can be configured with environment variables **at build-time**. These environment variables control the buildpacks used by the builder.

Two of the buildpacks used by Paketo Tiny Builder are [Paketo BellSoft Liberica Buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica#configuration) and the [Paketo Clojure Tools Buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/clojure-tools/blob/main/README.md#configuration), and can be configured with many environment variables. The most important one is `BP_JVM_TYPE`, which controls whether the container image will contain the JDK or the JRE (the default).

You can generate a container image containing the JDK (instead of the JRE) with this command:

```shell
pack build my_clojure_app:latest \
  --path . \
  --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny \
  --env BP_JVM_TYPE=JDK \
  --env BP_JVM_VERSION=11 \
  --env BP_CLJ_TOOLS_BUILD_ARGUMENTS="-T:build uber"
```

The layer containing the Java Development Kit (JDK) is 350 MB, more than double the size of the layer containing the JRE (148 MB).

### Example 3: Node.js Express app

I have a simple Express app which I use to receive and handle webhook events from Stripe. The app is written in TypeScript and bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). I compile the TS and generate the `bundle.js` on my laptop, and let the builder [gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/buildpacks) build the container image (which I then deploy to Cloud Run). Here is the command I use to create the container image:

```shell
pack build my_nodejs_app:latest \
  --path ./dist \
  --builder gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1
```

_Note_: `dist/` contains `bundle.js` and `package.json`

Using dive we can see that the container image layer corresponding to the Node.js runtime is called `google.nodejs.runtime`. It's roughly 101 MB in size and contains the `node` binary (75 MB) and two symlinks for npm and npx.

https://res.cloudinary.com/jackdbd/image/upload/v1643985444/google_nodejs_runtime_layer.png

The container image layer corresponding to the Express app is 42 MB, mostly due to its dependencies in `node_modules` (37 MB).

Another layer is the [Cloud Native Buildpack launcher](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/lifecycle/launch/). Here `cnb` is the **non-root** user that executes the commands in the container.

https://res.cloudinary.com/jackdbd/image/upload/v1643987650/cloud_native_buildpack_launcher.png

The second-to-last layer contains the configuration [metadata.toml](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/platform/0.7/platform.md#metadatatoml-toml) of the buildpack.

https://res.cloudinary.com/jackdbd/image/upload/v1643989213/cloud_native_buildpack_config_metadata.png

The last layer is just a symlink for the buildpack launcher.
