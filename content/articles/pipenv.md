When it comes to manage environments and dependencies in Python projects, a very popular combination includes [Virtualenvwrapper](https://www.giacomodebidda.com/virtual-environments-with-virtualenvwrapper/) to manage environments, and pip to install/remove Python packages. Of course, every time you start working on a project you need to remember to activate the virtual environment of that particular project. For example, with Virtualenvwrapper you would use `workon <your-python-project>`.

A few weeks ago I found out about [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/), an experimental project by Kenneth Reitz. While I was reading the documentation I couldn't help but notice how much Pipenv resembles the Javascript package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). With yarn — or [npm](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)>) — you have a single tool that you can use to install/remove packages **and** create/manage environments.

In this post I will show you how to use Pipenv in two scenarios: when starting a new project, and when installing the dependencies of a pre-existing project.

If you want to follow along, start with installing Pipenv _globally_:

```shell
pip install pipenv
```

## Starting a new Python project

Create a dummy repository and cd into it:

```shell
mkdir my-dummy-repo
cd my-dummy-repo
```

Create a Python 2 virtual environment:

```shell
pipenv --two
```

You should see this output in your terminal:

```shell
Creating a Pipfile for this project...
Creating a virtualenv for this project...
Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/bin/python2
New python executable in /home/jack/.virtualenvs/my-dummy-repo-zmrIuv74/bin/python2
Also creating executable in /home/jack/.virtualenvs/my-dummy-repo-zmrIuv74/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.

Virtualenv location: /home/jack/.virtualenvs/my-dummy-repo-zmrIuv74
```

The command you have just entered creates a new virtual environment and a `Pipfile`, a replacement of `requirements.txt`. In a `Pipfile`, all Python dependencies are declared with a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) syntax. To be honest, I don't particularly like the TOML syntax, and I find the `package.json` file (generated by npm or yarn) much more readable. Anyway, here is how the `Pipfile` looks at this point:

```toml
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
```

Let's say that we didn't really want to create a Python 2 environment, but a Python 3.6 environment. No big deal, with Pipenv we can remove the virtual environment with:

```shell
pipenv --rm
```

and create a Python 3.6 environment with:

```shell
pipenv --python python3.6
```

If you take a look at the `Pipfile`, you will see that nothing has changed. This is perfectly ok. We have just removed a virtual environment and created a new one. We didn't change any dependency.

```toml
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
```

Bu where is this virtual environment?

Pipenv creates all virtual environments at the location specified by the environment variable `WORKON_HOME`, just as virtualenvwrapper does. You can check where the virtual environment is by typing:

```shell
pipenv --venv
# or...
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
# or...
pip -V
```

In my case `WORKON_HOME` is `/home/jack/.virtualenvs/`, that's why the output of `pipenv --venv` is `/home/jack/.virtualenvs/my-dummy-repo-zmrIuv74`.

_Note:_ you can also activate, deactivate, remove this virtual environment with the same commands you would use for Virtualenvwrapper: `workon <your-virtual-environment>`, `deactivate`, `rmvirtualenv <your-virtual-environment>`.

Let's install some packages.

Let's say that for your project you need pandas. You can install the latest version with:

```shell
pipenv install pandas
```

Of course you can also choose a specific version when installing a dependency:

```shell
pipenv install requests==2.13.0
```

Finally, let's install a development dependency:

```shell
pipenv install ddt --dev
```

If you now type `pip list` in the terminal, you will see:

```shell
ddt (1.1.1)
numpy (1.13.1)
pandas (0.20.3)
pip (9.0.1)
python-dateutil (2.6.1)
pytz (2017.2)
requests (2.13.0)
setuptools (36.2.4)
six (1.10.0)
wheel (0.30.0a0)
```

Your `Pipfile` will look like this:

```toml
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]
ddt = "*"

[packages]
pandas = "*"
requests = "==2.13.0"
```

Now your dependencies are set on your system, but you still need to "freeze" them for everyone else. With the usual pip workflow, you could use `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. With Pipenv you have to type a lot less:

```shell
pipenv lock
```

which gives you this output:

```shell
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies...
Locking [packages] dependencies...
Updated Pipfile.lock!
```

The first time I used pipenv, it felt a bit weird. I am familiar with yarn, and with yarn I don't have to run two commands to install/lock the dependencies. I would just need to run `yarn add d3`, or `yarn add webpack --dev`. In fact, someone opened an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/404) and asked Kenneth why the need of manually invoking `pipenv lock` after `pipenv install` (or `pipenv uninstall`). Pipenv is still in an early stage, and Kenneth commented that he decided to have two commands because `pipenv lock` is quite slow (on my computer, locking the requirements for this dummy project took roughly 10 seconds).

It should be noted that you can easily combine install and lock in a single command:

```shell
pipenv install pandas --lock
```

Now that all dependencies are locked, let's have a look at the `Pipfile.lock` file (basically a json file):

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "hash": {
      "sha256":
        "a770116c27db7e68723c431e7a00bc50e32d6ae6c719998e01a332da646757b6"
    },
    "requires": {},
    "sources": [
      {
        "url": "https://pypi.python.org/simple",
        "verify_ssl": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "default": {
    "numpy": {
      "version": "==1.13.1"
    },
    "pandas": {
      "version": "==0.20.3"
    },
    "python-dateutil": {
      "version": "==2.6.1"
    },
    "pytz": {
      "version": "==2017.2"
    },
    "requests": {
      "version": "==2.13.0"
    },
    "six": {
      "version": "==1.10.0"
    }
  },
  "develop": {
    "ddt": {
      "version": "==1.1.1"
    }
  }
}
```

Another handy command is `pipenv update`, which updates pip to the latest version, uninstalls all packages, and finally re-installs all packages declared in the [packages] section of the `Pipfile` (for each package, it installs the latest compatible version).

```shell
Updating all dependencies from Pipfile...
Found 6 installed package(s), purging...
Uninstalling ddt-1.1.1:
  Successfully uninstalled ddt-1.1.1

⠸
All dependencies are now up-to-date!
```

_Note:_ you **should** put `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` under version control.

## Installing dependencies of a pre-existing project

Some weeks ago I discovered [Plotly Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash), a cool project based on React.js and the Plotly API. Dash allows you to develop reactive web apps and interactive dashboards in Python. I felt super-exited about it, because I have been looking for the Python equivalent of the [R Shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for a long time. I also wanted to try Pipenv in a real project, so I decided to develop a small project with Dash and to use Pipenv to manage the virtual environment and the project dependencies.

You can clone my Dash project via SSH:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jackdbd/dash-earthquakes.git
```

Then go to the project directory:

```shell
cd dash-earthquakes
```

Now you have to create the virtual environment. I developed this project in a Python 3.6 environment, so it makes sense for you to use the same setup:

```shell
pipenv --python python3.6
```

Install all dependencies. You could use the `--dev` flag to include all development dependencies, but in this small project I don't have them:

```shell
pipenv install
```

You can also update and lock the dependencies once again:

```shell
pipenv update
pipenv lock
```

Finally, you can have a look at the packages available in this virtual environment by typing:

```shell
pip list
```

## Pipenv and Travis CI

I use Pipenv for [dash-earthquakes](https://github.com/jackdbd/dash-earthquakes), a very simple dashboard that displays the most recent eathquakes in the world (if you are interested in how I created this application, I wrote an [article](https://www.giacomodebidda.com/posts/visualize-earthquakes-with-plotly-dash/) about it).

I wanted to setup [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) for this project, but it took me a while to figure out how to use pipenv in this environment. A possible solution comes from the [pipenv advanced documentation](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/advanced.html): use a `Makefile` to install pipenv and run the tests.

Here is how the `Makefile` looks like.

```
help:
	@echo '    init'
	@echo '        install pipenv and all project dependencies'
	@echo '    test'
	@echo '        run all tests'

init:
	@echo 'Install python dependencies'
	pip install pipenv
	pipenv install

test:
	@echo 'Run all tests'
	pipenv run py.test tests
```

And here is a basic `.travis.yml` file.

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - 3.5
  - 3.6
install:
  - make init
script:
  - make test
```

## Pipen and PyUp

I usually keep track of my Python dependencies with the [PyUp](https://pyup.io/) bot. Unfortunately, it seems that PyUp does not support pipenv at the moment.

Of course you can activate the virtual environment and create a `requirements.txt` with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, but you would still need to check that file in, to make it available for PyUp. That is confusing, because pipenv don't use requirement files.
