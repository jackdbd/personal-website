title: Interesting things other people did in 2016
---

Some time ago I followed a data science course taught by Jeff Leek on Coursera. The course was so good and thorough that eventually they decided to split it into several courses and create a [data science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) out of it.
During the course Jeff Leek mentioned that toward the end of the year he likes to compile a [list of things other people did during the year](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2016-12-20-noncomprehensive-list-of-awesome/).

I think it's a nice idea, so I'll make a list of the things I stumbled upon during the year and that I found interesting.

Here it is:

* Nathan Yau posted a scary but entertaining visualization on [how you will die](https://flowingdata.com/2016/01/19/how-you-will-die/). The analysis and data preparation was performed in R, while for the visualization he used D3.js.
* Omar Wagih created [Guess the Correlation](https://guessthecorrelation.com/), a hilarious game where you try to guess how correlated the two variables in a scatter plot are.
* Toby Walsh published a [short paper on AI and singularity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06462v1.pdf). Quite a different opinion than the one expressed by Ray Kurzweil in [The Singularity is Near](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near).
* Clayton d'Arnault wrote a really interesting article about information overload, one of the biggest problem of our hyperconnected society. The title couldn't be more appropriate: [Drowning in a Sea of Information](https://digitalculturist.com/drowning-in-a-sea-of-information-563a3160efbb#.2x8iotwh4). I really like the paragraph about [idea debt](https://jessicaabel.com/idea-debt/).
* Someone created [dsxyliea](https://geon.github.io/programming/2016/03/03/dsxyliea), a web page that gives you an idea about how people with dyslexia see text.
* Someone created an [Atari Breakout in a pdf](https://rawgit.com/osnr/horrifying-pdf-experiments/master/breakout.pdf). You have to view the PDF in Chrome to be able to play it. The author created this game to show that PDF has its own JavaScript scripting (which uses a completely different standard library from the Javascript available in a browser).
* Two twin teenagers built a fusion reactor in their bedroom and posted an [AMA on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4tgsaz/iama_i_built_a_fusion_reactor_in_my_bedroom_ama/).
* These guys created a really cool project about [Beer and IoT](https://monterail.com/blog/2016/monterale_breweree_how_we_merge_passion_of_brewing_beer_with_iot/).
* Charles Scalfani wrote an article on [why experts make bad teachers](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/why-experts-make-bad-teachers-ccaed2df029b#.rqtpbtiqf). Really, really interesting point of view.
* Rody Zakovich created a funny Sankey diagram on the [most common swear words in South Park season 1](https://public.tableau.com/views/SouthParkSeasonOneWordsAnalysis/TheWordsofSouthParkSeason1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no).
* Brandon Liu of [pureinformation.net](https://pureinformation.net/) created a beautiful map of New York where you can explore the [age of the buildings](https://pureinformation.net/building-age-nyc/#12/40.7457/-73.8841). I love maps like this one. I want to build something similar in 2017.
* Jose Aguinaga wrote a hilarious article about the state of the Javascript ecosystem, now that a new framework/transpiler/shiny thing seems to pop up every single day. [How it feels to learn Javascript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.iflg3l8s5).
* The University of Michigan created [Visualizing Health](https://www.vizhealth.org/gallery/), a website which hosts a collection of visualizations on healthcare topics. All visualizations are distributed via a Creative Commons license, which allows anybody – academics, healthcare organizations, even for-profit businesses — to adapt them for their own objectives.
* Christopher Möller put together a nice list of resources on [interactive journalism](https://github.com/wbkd/awesome-interactive-journalism?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav). I proptly starred this repository on my GitHub account.
* Deep Learning was the buzzword of 2016 (and probably it will be of 2017 too). This article about [Emoji & Deep Learning](https://getdango.com/emoji-and-deep-learning/) was a bit different from the usual neural network tutorial :-)

_Note: I was really tempted to steal some stuff from Jeff's list, there were really some good links..._
