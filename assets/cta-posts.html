    <h3>üó£Ô∏è Let's chat!</h3>

    <p>Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about any one of these topics (we can talk in English or Italian):</p>

    <ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>JavaScript, TypeScript, web development in general. I published <a
          href="https://www.npmjs.com/settings/jackdbd/packages" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">30+
          packages on npm</a>.</li>
      <li>Google Cloud Platform. I have been using their managed services (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, etc) for more than 2
        years.</li>
      <li>Zig. I'm really excited about this language. I have been using it since version 0.6. I wrote <a
          href="https://github.com/jackdbd?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=zig&sort=" target="_blank"
          rel="external noopener noreferrer">a few projects with it</a>.</li>
      <li>Code review of your open source project. Do you want a second opinion on your code? Send me a link and we'll
        review it together!</li>
      <li>Data visualization. I used D3, SVG and WebGL professionally. Nowadays I'm a bit out of the game, but I'm still
        interested in this topic.</li>
    </ol>
