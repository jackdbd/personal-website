# ads

Advertisements I use to market my services.

I'm following this convention:

- `linkedin-*.txt`: LinkedIn posts I post using a cron job (I'm using a [Pipedream workflow](https://pipedream.com/workflows) for **some** of these).
- `reddit-*.md`: posts for various subreddits.
- `stripe-*.txt`: copy for my [Stripe payment links](https://stripe.com/en-gb/payments/payment-links).
- `twitter-*.txt`: Twitter tweets I post using a cron job.

> :warning:
>
> Do not post `linkedin-free-consultation.txt` with a Pipedream workflow. I don't know why, it looks ok in Pipedream, but LinkedIn cuts the text short.
