 * This file can be use to extend Tailwind CSS with custom styles, but in my
 * opinion is better to avoid writing CSS here, and extend Tailwind styles in
 * the tailwind.config.js file instead.
 * Use this file only for quick experiments, then move them to
 * tailwind.config.js to avoid storing configuration in 2 different files.
