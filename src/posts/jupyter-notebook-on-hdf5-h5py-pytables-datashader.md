Last month at a [PyDataMunich](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/PyData-Munchen/) meetup I gave a short workshop on HDF5 and the python packages that we can use when dealing with HDF5 files.

I started the workshop with this picture:

"The HDF5 stack in Python",

As you can see, at the moment python developers have to make a choice between h5py and PyTables.

h5py provides a low-level, pythonic interface to the entire C HDF5 library. PyTables takes a different route and provides high-level abstractions that can make your life easier when writing to HDF5 or searching data in a HDF5 file. It also implements compression and chunking for you. You could say PyTables is more "battery included".

I have more experience with PyTables, so I am a little bit biased towards it.

What I really like about these projects is that they have very different philosophies, and for this reason the mainteners agreed to work together in creating a new python stack for HDF5.

It took me quite a while to prepare this workshop, but it was a great opportunity to play with the [New York City taxi dataset](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) and try out [Datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader), an innovative data rasterization pipeline that can be used to create data visualizations from massive datasets.

Here is an image I generated from the yellow taxis data from January 2015. Pickup locations are shown in blue. The pickup locations resulted from a search are shown in yellow.
