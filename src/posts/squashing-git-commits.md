In Git you can revise your commit history before pushing your changes to a remote repository. This comes in handy whenever you want to group certain changes together, edit commit messages, or change the order of commits.

## The golder rule

Squashing commits is an operation which rewrites the history of a git branch, so it should be performed **only on a local branch**. In other words, **never squash commits on a public branch**.

## Why is it useful?

When using a version control system like git, it's often considered a good practice to commit early and often. The problem with this approach is that you might end up with a history full of tiny little commits that aren't really that meaningful by themselves. You can solve this issue by squashing all commits related to a single topic into a single commit, and write a good commit message which explains what you implemented with your changes. If you do so, you'll end up with a leaner and more meaningful branch history.

> Squashing commits is a great way to group certain changes together before sharing them with others.

Let's imagine that you are working on a particular feature and as soon as you have some meaningful changes (e.g. a function) you would like to commit them. If you have already decided that you will squash some commits later on, you could commit some code without having to worry about writing a good commit message. For example you could write a message like `WIP on new feature`, because you know that this message will never make it to the branch history (WIP = Work In Progress). After several "WIP commits" you can squash them together into a single one, and write a good commit message for it.

## How is it done?

There isn't a `git squash` command. Squashing commits is an operation which can be performed in several ways by using other commands. I'm aware of 3 ways to do it:

1. reset
2. rebase
3. merge

## 1. Reset

This is the easiest approach. I first heard about this method [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7275658). You just have to start with a clean working tree and run `git reset --soft HEAD~X`, where `X` is the number of commits to squash together.

Let's make a simple example to see how it works.
After some specific commit (`Initial commit` in the image below) you wrote some changes and you committed 3 times. When you wrote those 3 commit messages you just wanted to save your work, maybe because you had to checkout a different branch and fix a bug, or maybe because you don't like to use `git stash`.

Let's say that with the 3rd "WIP commit" you have concluded your work on the new feature and you would like to wrap your changes up and start working on a different topic. This is what you should see with `gitk`:

Make sure that you have a clean working tree and run:

```shell
git reset --soft HEAD~3
```

This is the current situation: the changes are staged, but not yet committed.

Commit these changes, and this time write a meaningful commit message.

Notice that now that you have moved the HEAD, all changes done in the 3 "WIP commits" are no longer in the branch history, because you have just rewritten it. That's the reason why you should never squash commits on a branch where other developers are working.

## 2. Rebase

The rebase approach is a bit more complex but offers a much greater flexibility. You are no longer limited to squash all of your changes into a single commit, but you can squash X commits together into any number of commits between 1 and X-1. You can also change the order of commits!
The command you are looking for is `git rebase -i HEAD~X`.

Once again, let's pretend that you have 3 commits and you would like to squash them into one.

Use git rebase to carry on the squashing procedure.

```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

Now the default editor will display a message like the following one:

Since you want a single commit to appear in the branch history, you have to use one commit and squash the remaining two.

In this image **the last commit is the third one from the top**, but you don't want to keep that. You want to keep the first commit (the oldest one), and then squash the second one and the third one together into it. I must admit that I find it a bit counterintuitive and it took me a while to get used to it. If this sounds a bit weird to you, don't worry, because if we mess up we can still revert to the original situation with `git rebase --abort`.

In this specific example I wrote a meaningless message for the first commit (WIP 1), so I will `reword` it. If the commit message is fine, you can simply `pick` the commit. The other 2 commits will be squashed with `squash`.

When you accept the changes (`Ctrl + X` in Nano, `Esc` then `:wq` in Vim) you will see a recap like this one:

You can also edit this recap, which will appear in the commit _description_. Save your changes for this recap message. In `gitk` you should see something like this:

## 3. Merge

I must admit I've never tried this approach. It looks overly complicated and uses a git reset, so it's probably the riskiest option of the three. Anyway, this is where I found it:
