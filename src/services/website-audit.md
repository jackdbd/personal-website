I can audit your website and write a report about my findings.

The report will include recommendations and actionable advice on ⚡ **performance**, 🛡️ **security** and 🌐 **SEO**.

I will write the report in Google Docs and share it with you and whoever else you want.

I just need your email address and the URL of the website you want me to audit.

<div>
  {% renderTemplate "webc" %}
  <stripe-payment-link @allow-multiple="true" @price-lookup-key="website_audit_one_time">
    <span slot="cta">Book your website audit today!</span>
  </stripe-payment-link>
  {% endrenderTemplate %}
</div>

🤔 _Still not sure?_ Here is an [article I have recently written](https://www.giacomodebidda.com/articles/performance-audit-of-an-italian-news-website/) about web performance.

  {% renderTemplate "webc" %}
