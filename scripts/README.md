# scripts

Miscellaneous scripts I use for various tasks:

- [Manage my Stripe account](./stripe/README.md)
- [Search and post on various subreddits](./reddit/README.md)
- [Search and post on Hacker News](./hacker-news/README.md)
- [Search companies and people on LinkedIn](./linkedin/README.md)

These scripts display the help with `--info` instead of `--help`, so they don't conflict with the help of the `tsm` command.
