# Reddit scripts

## Search Reddit for keywords

Search a list of subreddits for posts containing one of the specified keywords:

```sh
node scripts/reddit/search.cjs \
  --subreddits 'learnmachinelearning,machinelearning,openassistant' \
  --keywords 'bard,chatgpt,chroma,embedding'
```

Note: the [Steampipe Reddit plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/reddit) seems **not** to allow searches across all Reddit. That's why I'm using [snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap) for this script.

You can also run this script from a GitHub workflow. For example, using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```sh
gh workflow run "Reddit search"
```

üß™ Post the ad [reddit-website-audit.md](../../assets/ads/reddit-website-audit.md) to [r/test](https://www.reddit.com/r/test/):

```sh
node scripts/reddit/post-ad-website-audit.cjs \
  --cta-md '[ORDER NOW](https://buy.stripe.com/6oE6oM6di9YA5eE005?prefilled_promo_code=REDDITSLAVELABOUR80)' \
  --test
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Post the ad [reddit-website-audit.md](../../assets/ads/reddit-website-audit.md) to [r/slavelabour](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/):

```sh
node scripts/reddit/post-ad-website-audit.cjs \
  --cta-md '[ORDER NOW](https://buy.stripe.com/6oE6oM6di9YA5eE005?prefilled_promo_code=REDDITSLAVELABOUR80)'
```

Note: the `--cta-md` option is required because I want to use different [Stripe promotion codes](https://stripe.com/docs/api/promotion_codes) for different subreddits and/or periods of the year, and because I want to experiment with different call to actions.

I created a GitHub workflow for this, but I still haven't decided whether I want to use it or not:

```sh
gh workflow run "r/slavelabour Website Audit"
```
