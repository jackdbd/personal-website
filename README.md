My personal website and blog, built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Workbox](https://github.com/googlechrome/workbox). Hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Features

- Autogenerated RSS feed and sitemap.
- just-in-time preloading with [instant.page](https://instant.page/)
- Service worker generated with [workbox-build](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-build) (in development, open Chrome DevTools and enable `Update on reload` in `Application > Service Workers` to always have the latest service worker).
- Performance reports with multiple [performance budgets](https://www.afasterweb.com/2020/01/28/performance-budgets-with-lighthouse/) using the [Lighthouse CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#using-the-node-cli) and [webhint](https://github.com/webhintio/hint).
- Run Lighthouse every commit thanks to the [Lightouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci).
- CSS on the critical path is inlined in the `<head>` and minified with [clean-css](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/inline-css/). All other CSS is managed by PostCSS.
