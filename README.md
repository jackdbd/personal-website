# My personal website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0842fe55-a9cb-484a-82d0-6a5c08b62d62/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/epic-benz-a3f006/deploys)

My personal website and blog, built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Workbox](https://github.com/googlechrome/workbox). Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Features

- Autogenerated RSS feed and sitemap.
- Tailwind CSS v2.0
- just-in-time preloading with [instant.page](https://instant.page/)
- Service worker generated with [workbox-cli](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli). The `workbox-config.js` file is watched by [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli) (in development, open Chrome DevTools and enable `Update on reload` in `Application > Service Workers` to always have the latest service worker).
- Performance reports with multiple [performance budgets](https://www.afasterweb.com/2020/01/28/performance-budgets-with-lighthouse/) using the [Lighthouse CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#using-the-node-cli) and [webhint](https://github.com/webhintio/hint).
- Run Lighthouse every commit thanks to the [Lighouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci).
- CSS on the critical path is inlined in the `<head>` and minified with [clean-css](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/inline-css/). All other CSS is managed by Tailwind.
- Post-build HTML validation with [netlify-plugin-html-validate](https://github.com/oliverroick/netlify-plugin-html-validate) and [HTML-validate](https://html-validate.org/usage/index.html).
- Post-build accessiblity check with [netlify-plugin-a11y](https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-plugin-a11y).
- Detect vulnerable JS librarie with [netlify-plugin-is-website-vulnerable](https://github.com/erezrokah/netlify-plugin-is-website-vulnerable).
- [Custom headers](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/#custom-headers) for the [Reporting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API):
  - [Report-To](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/reportingapi#header)
  - [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
  - [Network Error Logging](https://developer.cdn.mozilla.net/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/NEL)
  - [Permissions-Policy](https://scotthelme.co.uk/goodbye-feature-policy-and-hello-permissions-policy/)

## Installation

Install all project dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

This website is deployed on Netlify, so be sure to install the [Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/):

```sh
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

## Development

Launch [Netlify Dev](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#netlify-dev), recompile Nunjucks templates, JS/CSS assets, watch workbox configuration, reload the browser and share a live development server with a single command:

```sh
npm run netlify:dev
```

*Note 1*: with Netlify Dev you can test your Netlify Functions, but I don't think it can handle Netlify Forms submissions (yet).

*Note 2*: since all npm `dev:*` scripts run in parallel with `npm-run-all`, most likely the first time the service worker is generated you will get this message: `One of the glob patterns doesn't match any files. Please remove or fix...`. This occurs because workbox-cli finished generating the service worker before eleventy (or tailwindcss) had the time to build all the assets. Since this never occurr in production because I explicitly build the service worker *after* eleventy and tailwindcss - and also stop occurring indevelopment whenever I modify the `workbox-config.js` and reload it with chokidar-cli - I don't think it makes sense to worry about it.

## Production

Build all pages, CSS files and service worker:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Other commands

Some npm scripts in this repo have quite long names. Use [Node Task List](https://github.com/ruyadorno/ntl) to print all available npm scripts:

```sh
npm run menu
```

## Performance & security audit

```sh
# generate Lighthouse report with performance budget, view it, then check HTTP security headers
npm run webperf:home # or webperf:blog

# generate wenhint report
npm run webhint:home # or webhint:blog
# view all webhint reports
npm run webhint:reports
```
